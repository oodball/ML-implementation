## Abstract
This paper is a partial implementation of a 2006 paper by Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil (Caruana & Niculescu-Mizil, 2006). It is implemented as a part of the final project for the course COGS 118: Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms, taughtby Professor Tu Zhuowen. The paper will look at three different classification algorithms, performed using three different splits, and on three
different datasets taken from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.
